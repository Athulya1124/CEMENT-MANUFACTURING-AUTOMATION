# CEMENT-MANUFACTURING-AUTOMATION
The project is to address the business problem of minimizing the time interval between quality checks of cement samples. The purpose of this project is to enhance efficiency, reduce downtime, and ensure consistent product quality. The main aim is to minimize the time between intervals of quality check by 90% and thereby saving a cost of at least $1M. Minimizing the time interval between quality checks can help in early detection of issues, reducing the need for rework and saving on production costs.
